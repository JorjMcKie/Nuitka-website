.. description: Self-Introduction Jorj McKie

Hello everyone,

I am Jorj X. McKie (**not** my real name!) and I am an enthusiastic supporter of Nuitka. For the time being, my focus area within this package is standalone compilation and maintenance of the plugin feature.

Apart from extending Nuitka's support to virtually all Python packages living out there, my driving motivation in this respect is keeping up and improving the usability of Nuitka.

You may want to look into the `Nuitka Utilities <https://github.com/Nuitka/NUITKA-Utilities>`_ repository, which contains many things I am working on.
